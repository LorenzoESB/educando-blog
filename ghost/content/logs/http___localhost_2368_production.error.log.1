Dentre essas barreiras Podemos citar por exemplo o desconhecido, o despreparo, a falta de educação financeira para o cidadão e de domínio da própria matemática. \\n\\nComo começar a fazer uma poupança?\\nPrimeiramente é preciso entender que poupança não equivale à Caderneta de Poupança. Poupança é reserva financeira. Essa reserva pode até ser feita por meio da Caderneta de Poupança, mas também pode ser construída por diversos outros tipos de aplicação.\\n\\nDito isso, para construir uma poupança sólida e adequada às expectativas do poupador, é necessário pensar o quanto você precisa para manter seu padrão de vida no futuro. \\n\\nPondere os gastos. Se por um lado os custos com plano de saúde, remédios e despesas médicas auxiliares irão aumentar, por outro você vai deixar de gastar com a escola dos seus filhos, viagens mirabolantes que no futuro não teremos a mesma disposição para fazer…\\n\\nDá trabalho se planejar financeiramente e ter a disciplina para construir um futuro seguro e tranquilo.\\nMas e se eu precisar do dinheiro para alguma emergência?\\nNão saber o dia de amanhã gera uma insegurança nos potenciais investidores. Aplicar em um fundo no qual o dinheiro não possa ser retirado a qualquer momento, não atrai  aqueles que estão preocupados em se garantir em momentos de  despesas inesperadas. \\n\\nPode parecer mais seguro deixar o dinheiro na Caderneta de Poupança, mesmo que rendendo pouco a cada mês. Mas antes de começar a construir a poupança para a velhice é necessário já ter feito uma reserva financeira. Ou seja, aplicar esse dinheiro. Nós já falamos aqui de várias formas de fazer essa aplicação, como Tesouro IPCA+, Tesouo Selic e até mesmo em algum plano de previdência privada.\\n\\nPor outro lado, a  pesquisa do Banco Central apontou que apenas 1,9% dos brasileiros têm um plano de previdência privada.  Logo, percebe-se que as pessoas não têm de fato uma reserva para emergência de curto prazo. Elas entram na Previdência construir uma poupança, o que é louvável, mas sem antes ter estruturado uma reserva de curto prazo.\\n\\n\\nPasso a passo para uma poupança bem feita\\nAqui no Educando Seu Bolso nós já escrevemos alguns posts que podem te ajudar a manter suas finanças organizadas, como o Método dos Envelopes, por exemplo. De maneira geral, construir uma poupança estruturada se resume a três passos:\\n\\nEstabeleça objetivos para o curto prazo e escolha a aplicação mais adequada para isso. Não adianta ter uma reserva, como um título de longo prazo para ser retirado daqui a 30 anos,  e você daqui a seis meses precisar capitalizar esse dinheiro com urgência. Seja porque você perdeu seu emprego ou  não tem como pagar as despesas de casa, se a reserva foi pensada para o longo prazo, utilizá-la no curto prazo pode custar caro. Assim sendo, dê preferência para aplicações mais líquidas, que não vão pesar no bolso e cobrar grandes taxas para retirar o dinheiro a qualquer momento.  \\n\\nEstabeleça como segundo objetivo uma reserva financeira de médio prazo. Aquele dinheiro que pode ser usado para custear por exemplo a troca de carro que você pretende fazer daqui a cinco anos. Sempre analisando qual o investimento que mais se encaixa com esse objetivo, seguindo a mesma lógica do passo anterior.\\n\\nPor fim construa a poupança para a sua aposentadoria investindo no longo prazo. Mas é preciso ter mais paciência com a performance da aplicação financeira de longo prazo. Aplicações mais arriscadas que podem não performar bem no curto prazo porque foram talhadas para render bem no longo prazo. \\n\\nDessa maneira, você vai poder escolher os instrumentos financeiros mais adequados a cada um dos seus objetivos. Cada um com um perfil de risco e com prazo de maturação diferente. Assim, você vai poder até mesmo buscar uma renda extra ou deixar de fazer um gasto por impulso, porque você quer estar sempre colocando um pouquinho em cada um desses três objetivos.\\n\\n“Mas eu não consigo poupar nem pra um objetivo imagina pra três”\\n\\nEsse é um grande desafio para o ser humano: estabelecer metas e se pré-dispor a  cumpri-las. Mas esse é um exercício tanto necessário quanto recompensador, que vai fazer toda diferença no futuro. Obviamente que no começo será preciso dividir pouco dinheiro em três “gavetas”, mas mesmo que seja R$10,00, R$20,00, R$50,00 já está valendo.\\n\\nSe você não tem reserva financeira de curto prazo esqueça a aposentadoria. Crie primeiro uma poupança de curto prazo. O Brasil ainda está passando um momento difícil  e é fundamental conseguir manter a sua vida mesmo que imprevistos aconteçam. \\n\\nA poupança permite que você previna e contorne essas intempéries sem precisar tomar empréstimos, que é o que leva muitas pessoas a parar na lista de negativados.\\n\\nOutras formas de construir uma poupança para a aposentadoria\\nO teto da Previdência hoje é de  R$5.645,81 e é bante possível receber esse valor, ou até mais, mesmo sem contribuir mensalmente para a previdência social.\\nPara isso é preciso separar uma reserva, começar o quanto antes, mesmo que com pouco dinheiro e aplicar com segurança. Escolher bem a aplicação e ter disciplina são pontos fundamentais. Se você está aplicando para longo prazo, não é necessário, nem recomendável ficar olhando o rendimento disso todo dia. \\n\\nAqui no Educando Seu Bolso nós temos um simulador de aposentadoria gratuito, que te permite saber quanto você precisa investir, dada sua faixa etária, para poder tirar esse teto de R$5.645,81. Para aqueles que querem se aposentar mais cedo é possível pendurar as chuteiras antecipadamente com uma reserva financeira própria. \\n \\nUm alerta para a situação financeira do brasileiro\\nAlguns outros dados da pesquisa do Banco Mundial valem a pena ser citados.\\n\\n32,5% da população brasileira conseguiu poupar últimos 12 meses o que é muito pouco, menos da metade. Mais uma vez o Brasil está mal ranqueado, 15º entre 19 países americanos, alguns bastante mais pobres do que a gente. Em termos de finanças nós estamos acomodados com uma situação muito ruim.\\n\\nA pesquisa perguntou ainda aos brasileiros se eles teriam condições de desembolsar R$1.400,00 para realizar uma despesa extra. Como resultados mais da metade da população brasileira considerou impossível obter esse dinheiro. Nesse quesito o Brasil ficou em 107° lugar, dentre os 144 países pesquisados, sendo que essa quantia (R$ 1.400,00) foi estabelecida tendo como base o PIB de cada país.\\n\\nEsse é sinal é muito preocupante para as finanças do brasileiro. Isso pode ajudar a entender porque o cheque especial, nomes negativados e taxas do cartão de crédito tem um impacto  tão grande no bolso do cidadão. \\n\\n\\nA pergunta do Rubens\\n\\nOi Frederico eu tenho que receber o reembolso da poupança dos planos antigos Plano Collor e Plano Verão, devo deixar esse dinheiro na caderneta de poupança?\\n\\nAgradecemos a participação do ouvinte e ficamos felizes estar recebendo um dinheirinho legal. \\n\\nContextualizando, esse caso é um dos casos em que a correção da Poupança não foi feita devidamente. Os Bancos ficaram com uma boa parte do dinheiro dos poupadores. Alguns deles entraram na justiça e recentemente houve acordo em que os bancos se dispuseram a devolver esse dinheiro.\\n\\nA Caderneta de Poupança não é a melhor aplicação financeira de baixo risco. Outras aplicações como o Tesouro IPCA+, que tem um pouquinho mais de risco, ou o Tesouro Selic, que no quesito segurança se iguala a Poupança, possuem rendimentos melhores. Além disso, outros investimentos como CDB e LCI, LCA tendem a render um pouco mais e  possuem cobertura do Fundo Garantidor de Crédito, de até R$250.000 no vencimento .\\n\\nExistem também as plataformas de investimento como as corretoras de valores e os robôs de investimento, que possuem estruturas de aplicações financeiras seguras. Seu dinheiro fica na conta de corretora em seu próprio nome eles não mexem nos seus recursos, mas te dão uma recomendação de investimento.\\n\\nSem conhecer o perfil do Rubens é ser imprudente dar uma orientação mais detalhadas. Mas fica o convite para ele de escrever para nós aqui no Educando Seu Bolso dizendo bem qual é o seu perfil, quando e para que pretende usar esse dinheiro, para que a gente consiga ser um pouco mais específico.\\nConclusão\\nOs dados não são nada animadores, mas brasileiro que é brasileiro não desiste nunca, e nem deve!\\n\\nPrecisamos começar a correr atrás de uma educação financeira de qualidade, aprendendo desde cedo a importância de construir uma poupança e planejar o futuro. Isso, para que possamos gozar de uma aposentadoria tranquila, com qualidade de vida na velhice.\\n\\nNós da Educando Seu Bolso estamos sempre à disposição para dúvidas, sugestões e comentários. Entre em contato com a gente, teste os simuladores e ouça o podcast para saber mais.\\n\",\"html\":\"<p>“Trabalhador planeja se aposentar antes dos 65 anos”.

Obviamente que no começo será preciso dividir pouco dinheiro em três “gavetas”, mas mesmo que seja R$10,00, R$20,00, R$50,00 já está valendo. Se você não tem reserva financeira de curto prazo esqueça a aposentadoria. Crie primeiro uma poupança de curto prazo. O Brasil ainda está passando um momento difícil  e é fundamental conseguir manter a sua vida mesmo que imprevistos aconteçam. A poupança permite que você previna e contorne essas intempéries sem precisar tomar empréstimos, que é o que leva muitas pessoas a parar na lista de negativados. Outras formas de construir uma poupança para a aposentadoria O teto da Previdência hoje é de  R$5.645,81 e é bante possível receber esse valor, ou até mais, mesmo sem contribuir mensalmente para a previdência social. Para isso é preciso separar uma reserva, começar o quanto antes, mesmo que com pouco dinheiro e aplicar com segurança. Escolher bem a aplicação e ter disciplina são pontos fundamentais. Se você está aplicando para longo prazo, não é necessário, nem recomendável ficar olhando o rendimento disso todo dia. Aqui no Educando Seu Bolso nós temos um simulador de aposentadoria gratuito, que te permite saber quanto você precisa investir, dada sua faixa etária, para poder tirar esse teto de R$5.645,81. Para aqueles que querem se aposentar mais cedo é possível pendurar as chuteiras antecipadamente com uma reserva financeira própria. Um alerta para a situação financeira do brasileiro Alguns outros dados da pesquisa do Banco Mundial valem a pena ser citados. 32,5% da população brasileira conseguiu poupar últimos 12 meses o que é muito pouco, menos da metade. Mais uma vez o Brasil está mal ranqueado, 15º entre 19 países americanos, alguns bastante mais pobres do que a gente. Em termos de finanças nós estamos acomodados com uma situação muito ruim. A pesquisa perguntou ainda aos brasileiros se eles teriam condições de desembolsar R$1.400,00 para realizar uma despesa extra. Como resultados mais da metade da população brasileira considerou impossível obter esse dinheiro. Nesse quesito o Brasil ficou em 107° lugar, dentre os 144 países pesquisados, sendo que essa quantia (R$ 1.400,00) foi estabelecida tendo como base o PIB de cada país.

Essa é a chamada de uma pesquisa encomendada pela Federação Nacional de Previdência Privada e Vida (FENAPREV) ao Instituto IPSOS. Foram ouvidas 1.200 pessoas, com idades entre 16 e 60 anos, de 72 municípios brasileiros. Segundo o estudo, metade dos brasileiros pretendem se aposentar até os 64 anos. Por outro lado, 48% não souberam responder qual seria o valor da aposentadoria que receberiam. Além disso, embora 60% tenham considerado necessário fazer uma poupança ou um plano complementar de previdência, 55% não foram capazes de informar o percentual do salário que estariam dispostos a poupar por mês para garantir a aposentadoria. Esses dados são bastante preocupantes. Os resultados evidenciam uma certa contraditoriedade no comportamento do cidadão. Percebe-se que ao mesmo tempo em que a necessidade de garantir um bom fluxo de renda no futuro é reconhecida, existe um imediatismo e uma desorganização financeira, que impõe empecilhos para que esse objetivo seja alcançado. Aqui na Educando Seu Bolso buscamos sempre auxiliar os brasileiros na melhoria da sua saúde financeira. Diante desses e outros dados alarmantes, que apresentaremos ao longo do post, pretendemos provocar os brasileiros a planejarem melhor sua vida financeira. Além  de apresentar dicas bastante práticas para construir uma poupança sólida para o futuro. A pesquisa do banco mundial O Banco Mundial também fez recentemente uma pesquisa que aborda o planejamento da população para a aposentadoria. O estudo foi realizado com 150 mil pessoas, das quais 1.000 são brasileiros. Como resultado, concluiu-se que apenas 6% dos brasileiros entre 15 e 24 anos de idade têm guardado dinheiro para velhice em 2017. Esse mesmo índice, levando em consideração todas as faixas etárias, foi de 11% no Brasil. Nosso país foi centésimo primeiro colocado entre 144 países pesquisados, ficando atrás de nações muito pobres como Filipinas, Bolívia e Mali e abaixo da média dos países em desenvolvimento Uma questão mais comportamental que econômica Os dados sinalizam que essa é uma questão comportamental. O Brasil em centésimo primeiro lugar, e em outros estudos ainda pior ranqueado, demonstra que isso não apenas pobreza. Estamos atrás de vários países bastante mais pobres do que o Brasil. Além disso, estamos abaixo da linha média dos países em desenvolvimento. Não estamos nos comparando com países desenvolvidos ou bastante mais ricos, mas sim com o segmento que o Brasil faz parte. Portanto, não se pode atribuir esse resultado apenas à condição sócio-econômica. Dado o estado calamitoso das Finanças Públicas do país, as perspectivas são de que daqui a 20 ou 30 anos a capacidade financeira do Estado prover benefícios sociais será bastante reduzida. Portanto, é imprudente confiar que lá na frente o governo consiga carregar o peso desse envelhecimento populacional, vide todas as discussões que estão acontecendo sobre reforma da previdência. Ao mesmo tempo, percebe-se que o brasileiro ainda permanece acomodado e imediatista, privilegiando o consumo por impulso. Aqui no blog vemos exemplos de pessoas que muito cedo, ou ganhando muito pouco, já conseguem se preparar para criar uma poupança para futuro.  Então, o fator socioeconômico pode até pesar um pouquinho. Mas o que essas duas pesquisas apontam, e o que nós também vemos por experiência no Educando Seu Bolso, é que esse comportamento vem de uma mistura de fatores. Mesmo quando se reconhece a necessidade de poupar para emergência ou mesmo para a aposentadoria, existe uma lacuna que impede a operacionalização desse pensamento. Dentre essas barreiras Podemos citar por exemplo o desconhecido, o despreparo, a falta de educação financeira para o cidadão e de domínio da própria matemática. Como começar a fazer uma poupança? Primeiramente é preciso entender que poupança não equivale à Caderneta de Poupança. Poupança é reserva financeira. Essa reserva pode até ser feita por meio da Caderneta de Poupança, mas também pode ser construída por diversos outros tipos de aplicação. Dito isso, para construir uma poupança sólida e adequada às expectativas do poupador, é necessário pensar o quanto você precisa para manter seu padrão de vida no futuro. Pondere os gastos. Se por um lado os custos com plano de saúde, remédios e despesas médicas auxiliares irão aumentar, por outro você vai deixar de gastar com a escola dos seus filhos, viagens mirabolantes que no futuro não teremos a mesma disposição para fazer… Dá trabalho se planejar financeiramente e ter a disciplina para construir um futuro seguro e tranquilo. Mas e se eu precisar do dinheiro para alguma emergência? Não saber o dia de amanhã gera uma insegurança nos potenciais investidores. Aplicar em um fundo no qual o dinheiro não possa ser retirado a qualquer momento, não atrai  aqueles que estão preocupados em se garantir em momentos de  despesas inesperadas. Pode parecer mais seguro deixar o dinheiro na Caderneta de Poupança, mesmo que rendendo pouco a cada mês. Mas antes de começar a construir a poupança para a velhice é necessário já ter feito uma reserva financeira. Ou seja, aplicar esse dinheiro. Nós já falamos aqui de várias formas de fazer essa aplicação, como Tesouro IPCA+, Tesouo Selic e até mesmo em algum plano de previdência privada. Por outro lado, a  pesquisa do Banco Central apontou que apenas 1,9% dos brasileiros têm um plano de previdência privada.  Logo, percebe-se que as pessoas não têm de fato uma reserva para emergência de curto prazo. Elas entram na Previdência construir uma poupança, o que é louvável, mas sem antes ter estruturado uma reserva de curto prazo. Passo a passo para uma poupança bem feita Aqui no Educando Seu Bolso nós já escrevemos alguns posts que podem te ajudar a manter suas finanças organizadas, como o Método dos Envelopes, por exemplo. De maneira geral, construir uma poupança estruturada se resume a três passos: Estabeleça objetivos para o curto prazo e escolha a aplicação mais adequada para isso. Não adianta ter uma reserva, como um título de longo prazo para ser retirado daqui a 30 anos,  e você daqui a seis meses precisar capitalizar esse dinheiro com urgência. Seja porque você perdeu seu emprego ou  não tem como pagar as despesas de casa, se a reserva foi pensada para o longo prazo, utilizá-la no curto prazo pode custar caro. Assim sendo, dê preferência para aplicações mais líquidas, que não vão pesar no bolso e cobrar grandes taxas para retirar o dinheiro a qualquer momento. Estabeleça como segundo objetivo uma reserva financeira de médio prazo. Aquele dinheiro que pode ser usado para custear por exemplo a troca de carro que você pretende fazer daqui a cinco anos. Sempre analisando qual o investimento que mais se encaixa com esse objetivo, seguindo a mesma lógica do passo anterior. Por fim construa a poupança para a sua aposentadoria investindo no longo prazo. Mas é preciso ter mais paciência com a performance da aplicação financeira de longo prazo. Aplicações mais arriscadas que podem não performar bem no curto prazo porque foram talhadas para render bem no longo prazo. Dessa maneira, você vai poder escolher os instrumentos financeiros mais adequados a cada um dos seus objetivos. Cada um com um perfil de risco e com prazo de maturação diferente. Assim, você vai poder até mesmo buscar uma renda extra ou deixar de fazer um gasto por impulso, porque você quer estar sempre colocando um pouquinho em cada um desses três objetivos. “Mas eu não consigo poupar nem pra um objetivo imagina pra três” Esse é um grande desafio para o ser humano: estabelecer metas e se pré-dispor a  cumpri-las. Mas esse é um exercício tanto necessário quanto recompensador, que vai fazer toda diferença no futuro.

A pesquisa do Banco Mundial O Banco Mundial também fez recentemente uma pesquisa que aborda o planejamento da população para a aposentadoria. O estudo foi realizado com 150 mil pessoas, das quais 1.000 são brasileiras. Como resultado, concluiu-se que, em 2017, apenas 6% dos brasileiros entre 15 e 24 anos de idade tinham dinheiro guardado para a velhice. Levando em consideração todas as faixas etárias, esse índice foi de 11%. Nosso país foi 101° colocado entre 144 países pesquisados, ficando atrás de nações muito pobres como Filipinas, Bolívia e Mali. Além de estar abaixo da média dos países em desenvolvimento Uma questão mais comportamental que econômica Os dados sinalizam que essa é uma questão comportamental. O Brasil em 101° lugar – e, em outros estudos, ainda pior ranqueado –  demonstra que isso não é apenas consequência da pobreza. Estamos atrás de vários países bastante mais pobres do que nós. Além disso, estamos abaixo da linha média dos países em desenvolvimento. Não estamos nos comparando com países desenvolvidos ou mais ricos, mas sim com o segmento de que o Brasil faz parte. Portanto, não se pode atribuir esse resultado apenas à condição sócio-econômica. Aqui no blog vemos exemplos de pessoas que muito cedo, ou ganhando muito pouco, já conseguem se preparar para criar uma poupança para futuro.  Então, o fator socioeconômico pode até pesar um pouquinho. Mas o que essas duas pesquisas apontam, e o que nós também vemos por experiência no Educando Seu Bolso, é que esse comportamento vem de uma mistura de fatores. Mesmo quando se reconhece a necessidade de poupar para emergências ou mesmo para a aposentadoria, existe uma lacuna que impede a operacionalização desse pensamento. Dentre essas barreiras podemos citar, por exemplo, o despreparo, a falta de educação financeira para o cidadão e de domínio da própria matemática. Dado o estado calamitoso das finanças públicas do país, as perspectivas são de que daqui a 20 ou 30 anos a capacidade financeira do Estado para prover benefícios sociais será bastante reduzida. Vide todas as discussões que estão acontecendo sobre reforma da previdência. Portanto, é imprudente confiar que lá na frente o governo consiga carregar o peso desse envelhecimento populacional. Mais que nunca, cada um de nós precisa cuidar de seu próprio futuro. E é para já. Como começar a fazer uma poupança? Primeiramente é preciso entender que, quando dizemos poupança, não nos referimos à Caderneta de Poupança. Poupança é reserva financeira. Essa reserva pode até ser feita por meio da Caderneta de Poupança, mas também pode ser construída por diversos outros tipos de aplicação. Dito isso, para construir uma poupança sólida e adequada às expectativas do poupador, é necessário pensar o quanto você precisa para manter seu padrão de vida no futuro. Pondere os gastos. Se por um lado os custos com plano de saúde, remédios e despesas médicas auxiliares irão aumentar, por outro você vai deixar de gastar com a escola dos seus filhos e viagens muito intensas. Dá trabalho se planejar financeiramente. Mas é um trabalho que compensa muito, e pode render frutos mais rápido do que você imagina. Para garantir um futuro seguro e tranquilo, ter organização e disciplina é fundamental. Passo a passo para uma poupança bem feita Aqui no Educando Seu Bolso nós já escrevemos alguns posts que podem te ajudar a manter suas finanças organizadas, como o Método dos Envelopes, por exemplo. De maneira geral, construir uma poupança estruturada se resume a três passos: Estabeleça objetivos para o curto prazo e escolha a aplicação mais adequada para isso. Não adianta ter uma reserva, como um título de longo prazo para ser retirado daqui a 30 anos, se você daqui a seis meses precisar capitalizar esse dinheiro para alguma urgência. Seja porque você perdeu seu emprego ou não tem como pagar as despesas de casa, se a reserva foi pensada para o longo prazo, utilizá-la no curto prazo pode custar caro. Assim sendo, dê preferência para aplicações mais líquidas, que não vão pesar no bolso e cobrar taxas absurdas para retirar o dinheiro a qualquer momento. Por exemplo,  Tesouro Selic, ou fundos de Renda Fixa e CDB com liquidez diária. Estabeleça como segundo objetivo uma reserva financeira de médio prazo. Aquele dinheiro que pode ser usado para custear, por exemplo, a troca de carro que você pretende fazer daqui a cinco anos. Sempre analisando qual o investimento que mais se encaixa com esse objetivo, seguindo a mesma lógica do passo anterior. Alguns títulos do Tesouro Direto com vencimento no médio prazo, ou CDBs de baixa liquidez podem ser adequados. Por fim construa a poupança para a sua aposentadoria investindo no longo prazo. É preciso ter mais paciência com a performance desse tipo de investimento. Aplicações mais arriscadas que podem não performar bem no curto prazo porque foram talhadas para render bem no longo prazo. Daqui a pouco vamos falar mais sobre aplicações para o longo prazo. Dessa maneira, você vai poder escolher os instrumentos financeiros mais adequados a cada um dos seus objetivos. Cada um com um perfil de risco e com prazo de maturação diferente. Assim, você vai poder até mesmo buscar uma renda extra ou deixar de fazer um gasto por impulso, porque você vai querer estar sempre colocando um pouquinho em cada um desses três objetivos. “Mas eu não consigo poupar nem para um objetivo, imagina para três” Esse é um grande desafio para o ser humano: estabelecer metas e se pré-dispor a cumpri-las. É um exercício tanto necessário quanto recompensador, que vai fazer toda diferença no futuro. Obviamente, no começo será preciso dividir pouco dinheiro em três “gavetas”. Mas mesmo que sejam R$10,00, R$20,00, R$50,00, já está valendo. Se você não tem reserva financeira de curto prazo, deixe de lado a aposentadoria por enquanto. Primeiro crie primeiro uma poupança de curto prazo. O Brasil ainda está passando um momento difícil e é fundamental conseguir manter a sua vida mesmo que imprevistos aconteçam. A poupança permite que você previna e contorne essas intempéries sem precisar tomar empréstimos, que é o que leva muitas pessoas a parar na lista de negativados. Outras formas de construir uma poupança para a aposentadoria O teto da Previdência hoje é de R$5.645,81. É bastante possível receber esse valor, ou até mais, mesmo sem contribuir mensalmente para a previdência social. Uma pesquisa do Banco Central apontou que apenas 1,9% dos brasileiros têm plano de previdência privada. Esse é mais um sinal de como o brasileiro não se prepara financeiramente para o longo prazo. Porém, a previdência privada não é a única – e, em muitos casos, nem a melhor – forma de se poupar para a aposentadoria por conta própria. É possível fazer isso de muitas outras formas. Para isso, é imprescindível separar uma reserva, começar o quanto antes, mesmo que com pouco dinheiro, e aplicar com segurança. Escolher bem a aplicação e ter disciplina são pontos fundamentais. Se você está aplicando para longo prazo, não é necessário, nem recomendável, ficar olhando o rendimento disso todo dia. Aqui no Educando Seu Bolso nós temos um Simulador de Aposentadoria gratuito, que te permite saber quanto você precisa investir, dada sua faixa etária, para poder receber esse teto de R$5.645,81. Para aqueles que querem se aposentar mais cedo é possível pendurar as chuteiras antecipadamente com uma reserva financeira própria. Um alerta para a situação financeira do brasileiro Alguns outros dados da pesquisa do Banco Mundial valem a pena ser citados. 32,5% da população brasileira conseguiu poupar nos últimos 12 meses. Isto é muito pouco, menos de um terço. Mais uma vez o Brasil está mal ranqueado, 15º entre 19 países americanos, alguns bastante mais pobres do que a gente. Em termos de finanças nós estamos acomodados com uma situação muito ruim. A pesquisa perguntou ainda aos brasileiros se eles teriam condições de desembolsar R$1.400,00 para realizar uma despesa extra. Como resultado, mais da metade da população brasileira considerou impossível obter esse dinheiro. Nesse quesito o Brasil ficou em 107° lugar, dentre os 144 países pesquisados, sendo que essa quantia (R$ 1.400,00) foi estabelecida tendo como base o PIB de cada país. Esse é um sinal muito preocupante para as finanças do brasileiro. Isso pode ajudar a entender porque o cheque especial, nomes negativados e taxas do cartão de crédito têm um impacto tão grande no bolso do cidadão. A pergunta do Rubens Oi, Frederico.  Eu tenho que receber o reembolso da poupança do Plano Collor e do Plano Verão. Devo deixar esse dinheiro na Caderneta de Poupança? Agradecemos a participação do ouvinte e ficamos felizes por ele estar recebendo um dinheirinho legal. Contextualizando, esse é um dos casos em que a correção da Poupança não foi feita devidamente. Os Bancos ficaram com uma boa parte do dinheiro dos poupadores. Alguns deles entraram na justiça e recentemente houve acordo em que os bancos se dispuseram a devolver esse dinheiro. A Caderneta de Poupança não é a melhor aplicação financeira de baixo risco. Outras aplicações como o Tesouro IPCA+, que tem um pouquinho mais de risco, ou o Tesouro Selic, que no quesito segurança se iguala à Poupança, possuem rendimentos melhores. Além disso, outros investimentos como CDB, LCI e LCA tendem a render um pouco mais e possuem cobertura do Fundo Garantidor de Crédito, de até R$250.000 no vencimento. Existem também as plataformas de investimento, como as corretoras de valores e os robôs de investimento, que possuem estruturas de aplicações financeiras seguras. Seu dinheiro fica na conta de corretora em seu próprio nome eles não mexem nos seus recursos, mas te dão uma recomendação de investimento. Sem conhecer o perfil do Rubens seria imprudente dar uma orientação mais detalhada. Mas ficam dois convites para ele. O primeiro é usar nosso Simulador de Investimentos. Ele apresenta algumas das melhores opções em Renda Fixa. É gratuito e muito fácil de usar. O segundo é escrever para nós aqui no Educando Seu Bolso, dizendo bem qual é o seu perfil, quando e para que pretende usar esse dinheiro, para que a gente consiga ser um pouco mais específico. Conclusão Os dados não são nada animadores, mas brasileiro que é brasileiro não desiste nunca, e nem deve! Precisamos começar a correr atrás de uma educação financeira de qualidade, aprendendo desde cedo a importância de construir uma poupança e planejar o futuro. Isso, para que possamos gozar de uma aposentadoria tranquila, com qualidade de vida na velhice. Nós do Educando Seu Bolso estamos sempre à disposição para dúvidas, sugestões e comentários.

Essa é a chamada de uma pesquisa encomendada pela Federação Nacional de Previdência Privada e Vida (FENAPREV) ao Instituto IPSOS. Foram ouvidas 1.200 pessoas, com idades entre 16 e 60 anos, de 72 municípios brasileiros. Segundo o estudo, metade dos brasileiros pretende se aposentar até os 64 anos. Por outro lado, 48% não souberam responder qual seria o valor da aposentadoria que receberiam. Além disso, 60% dos entrevistados consideram necessário fazer uma poupança ou um plano complementar de previdência. Contudo, 55% não foram capazes de informar o percentual do salário que estariam dispostos a poupar por mês para garantir a aposentadoria. Esses dados são bastante preocupantes. Os resultados evidenciam uma certa contradição no comportamento do cidadão. Percebe-se que, ao mesmo tempo em que a necessidade de garantir um bom fluxo de renda no futuro é reconhecida, existem um imediatismo e uma desorganização financeira, que impõem empecilhos para que esse objetivo seja alcançado. Neste post, vamos falar sobre estes e outros dados que mostram o brasileiro em posição muito ruim, quando o assunto é preparação para aposentadoria. Por que isso acontece? Você verá que não é só porque somos um país ainda em desenvolvimento. Há fatores comportamentais. Além disso, falaremos sobre como constituir reservas financeiras de curto, médio e longo prazos. Como separá-las? Em que aplicar? Pretendemos provocar os brasileiros a planejarem melhor sua vida financeira.

Mas a tecnologia vem ajudando a acabar com esse problema. Você conhece os bancos digitais? Eles oferecem as contas digitais que são controladas pelo celular, e costumam ter taxas bem mais baratas do que as tradicionais. </span>\\n\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Economizar dinheiro é algo que todo mundo quer, e deixar de pagar taxas para os bancos já é uma boa ajuda na hora de economizar. A facilidade de resolver problemas bancários pelo celular e não ter que enfrentar filas nas agências bancárias é o sonho de muita gente. Por esses motivos, as contas digitais tem se tornado cada vez mais populares entre a população brasileira. </span>\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n<h2><b>Quais são as principais diferenças entre as contas digitais e as contas tradicionais?</b></h2>\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Bom, em primeiro lugar a economia de taxas que é possível o cliente fazer. Você deixa de pagar tarifas, ou paga muito menos do que pagaria em uma conta tradicional. As contas digitais ainda têm algumas (poucas) limitações, você não pode fazer o mesmo uso de agências, por exemplo. Ou seja, o atendimento fica um pouco limitado para aquelas pessoas que gostam de ir ao banco conversar com o caixa. </span>\\n\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Mas como a nova geração está menos preocupada com essa questão, pois gosta muito de aplicativos e de resolver as coisas muito rapidamente, isso não tem se transformado em um problema, pelo contrário, isso se tornou motivo de celebração. Celebração por que em fim, vamos passar a gastar um pouco menos de grana com tarifas e fazer a aplicação render um pouco mais, tomar empréstimo a custos mais baixos, taxas de juros mais baratas.  </span>\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n<h2><b>Por que é possível pagar menos com contas digitais?</b></h2>\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">É justamente o compartilhamento de economia que esses bancos têm ao não ter que manter uma rede de agência muito grande. Que custa caro, afinal de contas existem gastos com agência, seguranças, ponto físico, aluguel e coisas do tipo. Então essa economia que os bancos digitais fazem, por não terem essa rede de agências, acabam sendo compartilhadas com o cliente. </span>\\n\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Além de pagar menos taxas, não ter que sair de casa para ir até sua agência, deixar de gastar com gasolina ou com estacionamento já faz uma baita diferença. Sem contar o tempo que é poupado quando você pode fazer tudo pelo celular!</span>\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n<h2><b>Mas o banco digital é seguro? </b></h2>\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Existem mecanismos de dar segurança ao cliente nas contas digitais assim como existem nas contas tradicionais. Do mesmo modo que as contas tradicionais seguem a regulamentação do Banco Central (BC) as contas digitais também seguem a mesma regulamentação. Existe o Fundo Garantidor de Crédito, que garante aplicações até 250 mil reais no caso de falência da instituição.</span>\\n\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Para as instituições de pagamento também existem mecanismos de proteção que o Banco Central regulariza.</span> <span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">De uma maneira geral é possível dizer que a segurança é muito semelhante à segurança das contas tradicionais. </span>\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n<h2><b>Esses bancos oferecem cartão de crédito?</b></h2>\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Os bancos digitais oferecem cartão de crédito. Em muitos casos os bancos digitais oferecem cartões de crédito sem anuidade. Como é o caso do banco Inter, o banco Nubank, o Banco Next e a conta Pag!, entre outros. Além disso os bancos digitais também possuem um programa de pontos com recompensas.</span>\\n\\nA Nubank possui o Nubank Rewards, mas ao contrário do cartão de crédito tradicional possui uma anuidade de R$190,00 por ano. Nesse plano cada real gasto no cartão de crédito será convertido em 1 ponto, e esses pontos podem ser usados como desconto em passagens aéreas. Ou, ainda, usar os seus pontos para tirar os gastos da sua fatura.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n<h2><b>Quando o assunto é o cartão de crédito digital, ele também é seguro?</b></h2>\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Sim, inclusive, foi um dos fatores que motivou esse movimento. Os bancos não estavam concedendo crédito, ou quando concediam, eram limites ruins para muitos clientes. Então essas empresas passaram a entrar no mercado, atendendo um público que não era atendido pelos bancos . Então a conta digital é uma possibilidade bem legal, os aplicativos estão bem interessantes. Permitem o controle e o gerenciamento de gastos que vai facilitar o bom uso do dinheiro. </span>\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n<h2><b>Os bancos digitais estão crescendo. </b></h2>\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Quase 6 milhões de contas correntes e de pagamentos, estão em bancos digitais. Esse número é alto se pararmos para pensar que esse tipo de segmento entrou no mercado há menos de 3 anos. A tendência é que esse aumento continue. </span>\\n\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Até mesmo os bancos tradicionais estão se tornando mais digitais. É possível abrir uma conta no Bradesco, Itaú e no Banco do Brasil , por exemplo, apenas pelo smartphone. O que mostra que, de modo geral, o sistema bancário está se modernizando. Aos poucos todos os usuários vão se adaptar e aceitar melhor essa nova forma de conta. </span>\\n\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">A familiarização do usuário com os bancos digitais agregada com as vantagens das taxas mais acessíveis forma uma receita para o crescimento ainda mais relevante dos bancos digitais.</span>\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n<h2><b>Serviços oferecidos pelos bancos digitais. </b></h2>\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Assim como o preço, ou até a inexistência de taxas, os serviços oferecidos pelos bancos digitais possuem diferenças comparados ao dos bancos tradicionais. Os bancos digitais oferecem “serviços mais básicos”, porém aos poucos isso tem mudado. </span>\\n\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Nas contas digitais você já pode ter acesso à um cartão de crédito, conta corrente, conta pagamento e até mesmo empréstimo pessoal. Mas os bancos tradicionais ainda continuam sendo a melhor opção para clientes mais sofisticados, que buscam diversos produtos, como seguros e investimentos mais aprimorados.</span>\\n\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Por exemplo, um cliente que necessita de uma linha de crédito imobiliário para comprar um apartamento novo, ainda precisa de um banco tradicional. Mas não é por que você precisa de um banco tradicional que você não possa ter uma conta em um banco digital. </span>\\n\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">(nubank oferecendo empréstimo - link pro simulador ou o ranking de empréstimo)</span>\\n\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">(investimento online) </span>\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n<h2><b>O serviço na prática.</b></h2>\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Vamos exemplificar para entendermos melhor. Débora está fazendo faculdade de arquitetura e decidiu abrir uma conta universitária no Bradesco. Lá, ela paga uma taxa de R$6,90 de manutenção da conta por mês e ainda R$9,20 por cada transferência para outros bancos. </span>\\n\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Se ela tivesse olhado nosso simulador de contas digitais iria achar opções como o Banco Inter e o Nubank, por exemplo. Ambos possuem contas digitais sem tarifas de manutenção!

Mas a tecnologia vem ajudando a acabar com esse problema. Você conhece os bancos digitais? Eles oferecem as contas digitais que são controladas pelo celular, e costumam ter taxas bem mais baratas do que as tradicionais. Economizar dinheiro é algo que todo mundo quer, e deixar de pagar taxas para os bancos já é uma boa ajuda na hora de economizar. A facilidade de resolver problemas bancários pelo celular e não ter que enfrentar filas nas agências bancárias é o sonho de muita gente. Por esses motivos, as contas digitais tem se tornado cada vez mais populares entre a população brasileira.</p><h2 id=\\\"quais-s%C3%A3o-as-principais-diferen%C3%A7as-entre-as-contas-digitais-e-as-contas-tradicionais\\\"><b>Quais são as principais diferenças entre as contas digitais e as contas tradicionais?</b></h2><p>Bom, em primeiro lugar a economia de taxas que é possível o cliente fazer. Você deixa de pagar tarifas, ou paga muito menos do que pagaria em uma conta tradicional. As contas digitais ainda têm algumas (poucas) limitações, você não pode fazer o mesmo uso de agências, por exemplo. Ou seja, o atendimento fica um pouco limitado para aquelas pessoas que gostam de ir ao banco conversar com o caixa. Mas como a nova geração está menos preocupada com essa questão, pois gosta muito de aplicativos e de resolver as coisas muito rapidamente, isso não tem se transformado em um problema, pelo contrário, isso se tornou motivo de celebração. Celebração por que em fim, vamos passar a gastar um pouco menos de grana com tarifas e fazer a aplicação render um pouco mais, tomar empréstimo a custos mais baixos, taxas de juros mais baratas.</p><h2 id=\\\"por-que-%C3%A9-poss%C3%ADvel-pagar-menos-com-contas-digitais\\\"><b>Por que é possível pagar menos com contas digitais?</b></h2><p>É justamente o compartilhamento de economia que esses bancos têm ao não ter que manter uma rede de agência muito grande. Que custa caro, afinal de contas existem gastos com agência, seguranças, ponto físico, aluguel e coisas do tipo. Então essa economia que os bancos digitais fazem, por não terem essa rede de agências, acabam sendo compartilhadas com o cliente. Além de pagar menos taxas, não ter que sair de casa para ir até sua agência, deixar de gastar com gasolina ou com estacionamento já faz uma baita diferença. Sem contar o tempo que é poupado quando você pode fazer tudo pelo celular!</p><h2 id=\\\"mas-o-banco-digital-%C3%A9-seguro\\\"><b>Mas o banco digital é seguro?</b></h2><p>Existem mecanismos de dar segurança ao cliente nas contas digitais assim como existem nas contas tradicionais. Do mesmo modo que as contas tradicionais seguem a regulamentação do Banco Central (BC) as contas digitais também seguem a mesma regulamentação. Existe o Fundo Garantidor de Crédito, que garante aplicações até 250 mil reais no caso de falência da instituição.Para as instituições de pagamento também existem mecanismos de proteção que o Banco Central regulariza.De uma maneira geral é possível dizer que a segurança é muito semelhante à segurança das contas tradicionais.</p><h2 id=\\\"esses-bancos-oferecem-cart%C3%A3o-de-cr%C3%A9dito\\\"><b>Esses bancos oferecem cartão de crédito?</b></h2><p>Os bancos digitais oferecem cartão de crédito. Em muitos casos os bancos digitais oferecem cartões de crédito sem anuidade. Como é o caso do banco Inter, o banco Nubank, o Banco Next e a conta Pag!, entre outros. Além disso os bancos digitais também possuem um programa de pontos com recompensas. A Nubank possui o Nubank Rewards, mas ao contrário do cartão de crédito tradicional possui uma anuidade de R$190,00 por ano. Nesse plano cada real gasto no cartão de crédito será convertido em 1 ponto, e esses pontos podem ser usados como desconto em passagens aéreas. Ou, ainda, usar os seus pontos para tirar os gastos da sua fatura.</p><h2 id=\\\"quando-o-assunto-%C3%A9-o-cart%C3%A3o-de-cr%C3%A9dito-digital-ele-tamb%C3%A9m-%C3%A9-seguro\\\"><b>Quando o assunto é o cartão de crédito digital, ele também é seguro?</b></h2><p>Sim, inclusive, foi um dos fatores que motivou esse movimento. Os bancos não estavam concedendo crédito, ou quando concediam, eram limites ruins para muitos clientes. Então essas empresas passaram a entrar no mercado, atendendo um público que não era atendido pelos bancos . Então a conta digital é uma possibilidade bem legal, os aplicativos estão bem interessantes. Permitem o controle e o gerenciamento de gastos que vai facilitar o bom uso do dinheiro.</p><h2 id=\\\"os-bancos-digitais-est%C3%A3o-crescendo\\\"><b>Os bancos digitais estão crescendo.</b></h2><p>Quase 6 milhões de contas correntes e de pagamentos, estão em bancos digitais. Esse número é alto se pararmos para pensar que esse tipo de segmento entrou no mercado há menos de 3 anos. A tendência é que esse aumento continue. Até mesmo os bancos tradicionais estão se tornando mais digitais. É possível abrir uma conta no Bradesco, Itaú e no Banco do Brasil , por exemplo, apenas pelo smartphone. O que mostra que, de modo geral, o sistema bancário está se modernizando. Aos poucos todos os usuários vão se adaptar e aceitar melhor essa nova forma de conta. A familiarização do usuário com os bancos digitais agregada com as vantagens das taxas mais acessíveis forma uma receita para o crescimento ainda mais relevante dos bancos digitais.</p><h2 id=\\\"servi%C3%A7os-oferecidos-pelos-bancos-digitais\\\"><b>Serviços oferecidos pelos bancos digitais.</b></h2><p>Assim como o preço, ou até a inexistência de taxas, os serviços oferecidos pelos bancos digitais possuem diferenças comparados ao dos bancos tradicionais. Os bancos digitais oferecem “serviços mais básicos”, porém aos poucos isso tem mudado. Nas contas digitais você já pode ter acesso à um cartão de crédito, conta corrente, conta pagamento e até mesmo empréstimo pessoal. Mas os bancos tradicionais ainda continuam sendo a melhor opção para clientes mais sofisticados, que buscam diversos produtos, como seguros e investimentos mais aprimorados.Por exemplo, um cliente que necessita de uma linha de crédito imobiliário para comprar um apartamento novo, ainda precisa de um banco tradicional. Mas não é por que você precisa de um banco tradicional que você não possa ter uma conta em um banco digital.
